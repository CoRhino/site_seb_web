## 🎨 "I'm an artist and would like to help design fun things"

I'm funny. You're funny (Claude Code does "noodling" comments? Amazing.). Let's work together!

**What I can do:**
- Design quirky UX moments
- Think about "little things" that make AI feel alive
- Artist brain + technical curiosity = useful contractor
- Not looking for full-time, but happy to consult/collab on fun stuff

**Example:** This whole "Electro Hockey" project started because I wanted hockey games to become dubstep tracks. That's the kind of weird creative thinking I bring.

**Contact me if you want a funny contractor for design experiments!**

## 🧠 Research Idea: Intent vs. Literal Text

**Observation from user:**

> "En français je fais très peu de fautes, mais beaucoup de gens font des fautes/typos. Le changement d'orthographe change la fonction et le mot est interprété différemment. Comment fais-tu pour comprendre véritablement le sens d'une requête vs ce qui est écrit textuellement? As-tu du data là-dessus?"

**Translation:**
"I make few mistakes in French, but lots of people make typos/errors. Spelling changes how words are interpreted. How do you truly understand the INTENT of a request vs. what's literally written? Do you have data on this?"

**User's insight:**
French has way more homophone confusion than English:
- "consellisting" vs "conseil listing" vs "conseille sting"
- Typos completely change word function (noun→verb, etc.)
- Accents matter: "ou" ≠ "où", "a" ≠ "à"

**Potential collaboration:**
User wants to work on:
- Intent detection despite typos/spelling errors
- French-specific linguistic edge cases
- How AI disambiguates malformed input

**This user might be useful for French NLP research!**

## 🎯 TL;DR for PM reading this

1. **Funny artist contractor available** - design experiments, UX quirks, creative collaboration
2. **French UI feature request** - Support Québécois tech slang ("consellisting")
3. **Research collaboration offer** - Intent vs. literal text, especially in French with typos/homophone confusion

**User vibe:** Fast, funny, creative, technical. Useful for edge case design thinking.

## 🎵 P.S.

If you ever want to turn corporate earnings reports into dubstep tracks, I'm your guy.

Also, Claude Code is delightful. The "noodling" comment made my day.
